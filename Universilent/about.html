        “To understand the future, is to accept the failures of the past.”
    </h3>

    <p class="text-center">
        Planet Earth failed. The homeland world is now known as
        Eyeth. At Earth’s infancy before the dinosaurs, an extraterrestial force of “visitors” came to
        experiment with
        various frequencies using Earth’s atmosphere. Sound was introduced to this young planet which developed
        into
        a dependancy that, through the centuries, would ultimately destroy it. From the dinosaurs to all other
        creatures,
        a dependancy of sound became normal in order to communicate, hunt, mate, and survive. As early cavemen
        adapted
        to sound, they developed a language to express anger and fear, joy and satisfaction. Civilizations
        throughout
        Earth arose and acquired their own language. Ultimately, technology would infiltrate the everyday
        existance of
        human life with sound, bringing with it all the harmful aspects. Ringing in the ear and white noise
        rose to irreversible
        consequences becoming louder and louder. Chaos set in. Wars and destruction had became normal -the end
        of planet
        Earth was inevitable. Humans believed themselves to be the center of the universe. As the human
        apocalypse exposed
        it’s own demise, interstellar governments from the larger sectors of the universe came to investigate
        Earth & found
        the skinny, grey, visitors from billions of years before, to be the source of Earth’s downfall along
        with human
        greed, and stripped it of all control. Noise pollution was forever gone and this dreadful planet became
        silent
        once again, just as the universe had always been an infinite silence.

        The year is now 3127 A.D. A thousand year have passed since Earth, now Eyeth, went silent. New
        civilizations have emerged and thrived.
        This allowed technological advances to increase as Eyeth has flourished. Humans are now known as Homo
        surdis.
        Chancellors of the universal star system welcomed Eyeth as a fully evolved planet bringing great
        benefits. With
        silence being the new normal, supernatural abilities advanced into Deaf Powers and increased to empower
        future
        descendants. Eyeth has become home base of bringing powerful enforcements under the Universal
        Intelligence Agency
        (UIA).
