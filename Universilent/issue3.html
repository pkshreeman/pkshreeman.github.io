        An incident during a battle in the past reveals how Tombraiser ultimately betrayed his own  team and turned against Eyeth Corp. Captain Stigmata's squad were able to locate the survivors of the Rainbow Phoenix that had crashed into an uncharted planet. Now they must face their rival and traitor again. The plot thickens as their conspirator claims to have finally discovered Stigmata's weakness, thus diminishing the squad's hopes for a rejoiceful homecoming.
