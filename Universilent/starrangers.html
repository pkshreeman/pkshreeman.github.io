           Artist's Note: Introduction to StarRangers
       </h3>
       <p>
        The Star Rangers comics that you will be viewing has a historical context in relation to the birth of the UniverSilent. </br></br>

        Years ago when I was a student at National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID),  I was member of a club consisting of comic artists called Sequential Artists Guild (SAG).  Our club had a project where the members would work together on a project each quarter.  The members voluntarily produces between five to ten pages each to create our own graphic stories. By the end of the quarter, these stories will be published in book titled “Tigers’ Tales”. </br></br>
        
        After one night of watching a Japanese animation film called Gundam, I had a dream of being some kind of power ranger in future traveling in the space.  It inspired me to create this graphic tale, which became Star Ranger and published them in Tiger’s Tales issue. </br></br>
        
        Originally, I wanted to create the story of Deaf characters, but struggled to develop the characters due to limited time between homework, projects and the deadline for publication.  So, I ended up drawing normal characters. </br></br>
        
        Unfortunately, I have not had opportunity to continue working on the next issue of Star Rangers, and eventually (unexpectedly as well) left NTID. </br></br>
        
        After a decade, I heeded the calling and revisited the Deaf character development when I first attempted it with Star Rangers.  After reviewing my original artworks, and exploring on how to convert the work into more complete story and transcend the earlier limits to accomplish my dreams.  Recreating the concepts via Star Rangers,  I became confident with my vision and birthed a new universe called UniverSilent.  After successful production of first two issues in UniverSilent, I now share my inspirational story and materials with you. </br></br>
        
        Enjoy!
