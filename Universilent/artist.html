        <h1> About the Artist </h1>
        <p class="text-center">

            Kevin was born in 1975. At 10 months, his parents discovered that he was profoundly deaf. After testing
            and researching the
            medical backgrounds of the family, it was concluded that Kevin’s deafness was due to Waardenburg
            Syndrome, a
            genetic disorder from his father’s side, causing bilateral deafness from underdeveloped cochleas. At
            the age
            of 14, Kevin had decided to undergo the cochlear implant surgery which was under the testing phase of
            investigation
            process for FDA approval. At 16, Kevin transfered to Jacksonville Illinois School for the Deaf (ISD)
            and quickly
            adjusted to a larger population of Deaf students like himself. His confidence grew and he made the
            decision not
            to wear the hearing device any longer and embraced his role in the Deaf world. Kevin’s talent in
            drawing came
            early in his toddler years with animals and dinosaurs, then later to comic superheroes. He realized his
            deafness
            was not a loss but a gift, and developed his sense of sight to a level of detail he worked into his own
            original
            characters. This has become his hobby and passion since. After graduation from ISD, he enrolled at
            National Technical
            Institute for the Deaf in Rochester, New York, where he majored for 2 years in applied arts and
            computer graphics.
            The summer before his 3rd year, he reunited with his high school sweetheart, Tesha Evans, and they
            married in
            2002. Kevin worked at a retail store close to home until he decided he needed to return to college to
            complete
            his major. After family medical issues and other events, Kevin and Tesha moved back to Southern
            Illinois to be
            closer to family. Working again in retail, Kevin has continued to recreate a comic he wrote while back
            in college.
            He’s made the majority of his characters Deaf in the futuristic world of Eyeth -a world with no sound-
            just as
            Kevin’s world is. Kevin’s dream is to use his talent and creativity full time. He hopes that the young,
            old,
            Deaf and hearing people will enjoy this story and its characters, and look forward to the next issue.
