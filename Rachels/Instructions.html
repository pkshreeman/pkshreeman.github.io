<h1> The first step is to create an account here: <a href="https://login.utexas.edu/login/cdcservlet?goto=https%3A%2F%2Futdirect.utexas.edu%3A443%2F&RequestID=548491190&MajorVersion=1&MinorVersion=0&ProviderID=https%3A%2F%2Futdirect.utexas.edu%3A443%2Famagent%3FRealm%3D%2Fadmin%2Futdirect-realm&IssueInstant=2016-01-22T19%3A04%3A07Z"> Link </a> </h1>



<br>
<p>
  Once you have completed this step, you then go to the following link:
  <a href= "https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/degree/audits/"> Interacive Degree audit</a>  But you would want to start entering your ACC courses by using this <a href = "https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/degree/audits/planner/transfer_course/"> link </a>  It will list colleges, and you list the ACC, and the year to enter the courses.  I think you will be fine from this point on.
</p>

<p>
  In addition, please review this <a href = "https://admissions.utexas.edu/apply/transfer-admission"> page </a>
