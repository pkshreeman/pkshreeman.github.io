# You are right in smack of it! Welcome!

## Explanation
This is my personal website space where I learn and mess up my website on regular basis.  Right now what I have done so far:
- Incorporated Knockout.js to iterate through data set, instead of hard coding all that html.  I **love** it!.
- Updated my quote machine to incorporate API from quotesondesign.
- Implemented horizontal scrolling for mobile-easy browsing
- Added collapsing elements as part of button.  Not sure I really like it, and probably will modify it to something more cool.
- I initially did not want to use Bootstrap, but I liked modals so much that I wanted to practice with it more.  I finally decided it was time to spend some quality time with the Bootstrap framework and learn some of their deeper secrets.
- This is almost mobile-first web design.  All the layout is considered from mobile-first perspective.
- Completed with 95% success for carousel application of projects.



## My next goals:
1. Implement a fully functional self-enclosed webpage within a modal (not likely to be mobile friendly tho...)...use detection to deactivate in mobile?  (Man, mobile users are missing out!)
2. Add a working div where I can simulate the CodePen games/projects
3. ~~Next step I am considering adding is http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel~~ Completed on Day 0 of my 100DaysOfCode
